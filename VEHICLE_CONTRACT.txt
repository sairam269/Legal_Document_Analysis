Subtle Legal Loopholes / Ambiguities (5):

Section 2.3 (“Possession vs. Title”) – Buyer assumes all risk upon taking possession, but there’s no clear timeline for actual title transfer. Could lead to disputes over ownership if Vehicle is damaged or lost before title is officially recorded.

Section 3.1(b) (“to the best of Seller’s knowledge…no liens”) – “to the best of knowledge” leaves room for undisclosed liens, creating ambiguity over true lien status.

Section 4.1 (“50% within 30 days following delivery”) – Does not define what happens if Buyer fails to pay the second installment; Seller has no immediate remedy outlined.

Section 5.2 (“Buyer shall indemnify Seller for any damages resulting from Buyer’s use prior to formal registration”) – Contradicts the usual allocation of risk; could be interpreted to make Buyer liable for Seller’s pre-possession obligations.

Section 2.2 (“Vehicle transferred as-is, without warranties except as may be provided under federal or state law”) – This could be interpreted inconsistently; some state laws impose minimum implied warranties regardless of “as-is” disclaimers.
